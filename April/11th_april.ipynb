    "Ans:\n",
    "An ensemble technique in machine learning is a method of combining the predictions of multiple models to improve the accuracy and robustness of the overall prediction.\n",
    "The idea behind an ensemble technique is that by combining multiple models, each with its strengths and weaknesses, \n",
    "the resulting prediction is more accurate and reliable than any single model on its own.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several types of ensemble techniques in machine learning, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "Bagging: This involves training multiple models on different subsets of the training data and combining their predictions using an averaging or voting method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Boosting: This involves training a series of models sequentially, where each subsequent model is trained to correct the errors made by the previous model.\n",

    "Q2. Why are ensemble techniques used in machine learning?\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "Ensemble techniques are used in machine learning for several reasons, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Improved Accuracy: Ensemble techniques can improve the accuracy of the prediction by combining the predictions of multiple models. \n",
    "This is because each model in the ensemble may have its strengths and weaknesses, and by combining their predictions, the overall accuracy can be improved.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Robustness: Ensemble techniques can also improve the robustness of the prediction by reducing the impact of individual models errors.\n",
    "If one model in the ensemble makes an incorrect prediction, the other models can compensate for it, reducing the overall impact of the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Overfitting: Ensemble techniques can also help to reduce overfitting, a common problem in machine learning where the model learns to fit the training data too closely, \n",
    "resulting in poor performance on new data. \n",
    "By combining multiple models, ensemble techniques can help to reduce the risk of overfitting and improve the generalization performance of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Flexibility: Ensemble techniques can be applied to a wide range of machine learning algorithms, including decision trees, neural networks, and\n",
    "support vector machines, making them a flexible and versatile approach to improving model performance."
