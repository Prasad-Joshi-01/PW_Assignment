    "1.Learning rate (or step size): This parameter controls the contribution of each weak learner to the final model.\n",

    "\n",
    "Boosting algorithms combine weak learners to create a strong learner through a process of weighted averaging or weighted voting. Heres how it works:\n",

    "a. Weighted averaging: In this method, each weak learners prediction is multiplied by a weight that reflects its accuracy. \n",
    "The weighted predictions are then averaged to obtain the final prediction. \n",
    "The weights are typically proportional to the accuracy of the weak learner, with more accurate weak learners given a higher weight.\n",

    "b. Weighted voting: In this method, each weak learners prediction is counted as a vote, and the final prediction is the one with the most votes.\n",
    "Each weak learners vote is weighted by its accuracy, with more accurate weak learners given a higher weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind combining weak learners in this way is that each weak learner has its own strengths and weaknesses, and by combining them, the algorithm can create a more accurate and robust model. \n",
