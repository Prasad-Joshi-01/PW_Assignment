    "Q1. What is the difference between Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding? Provide an example of when you\n",
    "might choose one over the other.\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "Both Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding are techniques used to transform categorical data into numerical data.\n",
    "However, they differ in how they assign numerical values to categorical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Label Encoding, each unique category in a variable is mapped to a unique numerical value.\n",
    "For example, in a dataset with a \"color\" variable that has categories \"red\", \"blue\", and \"green\", Label Encoding would map \"red\" to 1, \"blue\" to 2, and \"green\" to 3. \n",
    "The order in which the categories are mapped is arbitrary and has no intrinsic meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, in Ordinal Encoding, the categories are mapped to numerical values based on an explicit order or hierarchy.\n",
    "For example, if the \"color\" variable represented the ranking of primary colors by popularity, we could encode the categories as \"red\"=1, \"blue\"=2, and \"green\"=3.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, we might choose Label Encoding when the categorical variable has no intrinsic order, \n",
    "while Ordinal Encoding would be used when there is a meaningful ordering to the categories. \n",
    "For example, in the \"color\" variable above, we would use Label Encoding if the colors were randomly assigned to objects, but we would use Ordinal Encoding if the colors were ranked by preference or popularity."

    "Q2. Explain how Target Guided Ordinal Encoding works and provide an example of when you might use it in\n",

    "Ans:\n",
    "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a technique used to encode categorical variables by assigning numerical values based on their relationship with the target variable. \n",
    "The main idea behind this technique is to rank the categories of the categorical variable based on their impact on the target variable.\n",
    "In other words, categories that have a similar impact on the target variable are assigned similar numerical values.\n",

    "Here are the steps involved in Target Guided Ordinal Encoding:\n",
    "1.Calculate the mean of the target variable for each category in the categorical variable.\n",
    "2.Rank the categories based on their mean target value, with the category with the highest mean target value receiving a rank of 1, \n",
    "and the category with the lowest mean target value receiving a rank of n (where n is the number of categories).\n",

    "Q3. Define covariance and explain why it is important in statistical analysis. How is covariance calculated?\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "Covariance is a statistical measure that shows how two variables are related to each other.\n",
    "Specifically, it measures the degree to which two variables vary together, or how much they change in relation to each other.\n",
    "In other words, it shows the extent to which two variables move in the same direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance is important in statistical analysis because it helps to identify the relationship between two variables.\n",
    "If the covariance between two variables is positive, it means that the variables tend to increase or decrease together.\n",
    "If the covariance is negative, it means that one variable tends to increase when the other decreases, and vice versa.\n",
    "If the covariance is zero, it means that there is no linear relationship between the two variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance is calculated using the following formula:\n",
    "cov(X, Y) = Σ [ (xi - mean(X)) * (yi - mean(Y)) ] / (n - 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "cov(X, Y) is the covariance between X and Y\n",
    "Σ is the sum of\n",
    "xi is the ith value of X\n",
    "mean(X) is the mean of X\n",
    "yi is the ith value of Y\n",
    "mean(Y) is the mean of Y\n",
    "n is the number of observations\n",
    "In other words, to calculate the covariance between two variables, we first subtract the mean of each variable from its values. We then multiply the differences for each observation, and sum these products. Finally, we divide the sum by the number of observations minus one.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting value can be interpreted as follows:\n",
    "If the covariance is positive, it means that the two variables tend to move together.\n",
    "If the covariance is negative, it means that the two variables tend to move in opposite directions.\n",
    "If the covariance is zero, it means that there is no linear relationship between the two variables."
