    "Q1. Explain the difference between simple linear regression and multiple linear regression. Provide an\n",
    "example of each.\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "Simple linear regression is a statistical method that involves finding a linear relationship between two variables.\n",
    "One variable is considered the independent variable or predictor, while the other is the dependent variable or response. \n",
    "The goal of simple linear regression is to create a linear equation that can predict the value of the dependent variable based on the value of the independent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a simple linear regression could be used to predict the salary of an employee based on their years of experience. \n",
    "In this case, the independent variable would be years of experience, and the dependent variable would be salary.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, multiple linear regression is a statistical method that involves finding a linear relationship between multiple independent variables and\n",
    "a dependent variable. \n",
    "The goal of multiple linear regression is to create a linear equation that can predict the value of the dependent variable based on the values of two or more independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, multiple linear regression could be used to predict a students final grade based on their study time, their attendance, and their quiz scores.\n",
    "In this case, the independent variables would be study time, attendance, and quiz scores, and the dependent variable would be the final grade."

    "Ans:\n",
    "Linear regression is a statistical method used to establish a linear relationship between one or more independent variables and a dependent variable. \n",
    "In order for the results of a linear regression analysis to be valid and reliable, certain assumptions must be met. These assumptions are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Linearity: There should be a linear relationship between the independent variable(s) and the dependent variable.\n",
    "2.Independence: The observations should be independent of each other.\n",
    "3.Homoscedasticity: The variance of the errors should be constant across all levels of the independent variable(s).\n",
    "4.Normality: The residuals (the difference between the predicted and actual values of the dependent variable) should be normally distributed.\n",
    "5.No multicollinearity: The independent variables should not be highly correlated with each other.\n",
    "6.No influential outliers: There should be no influential outliers that have a disproportionate effect on the regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "To check whether these assumptions hold in a given dataset, several diagnostic tests can be used. These include:\n",
    "1.Scatter plots: Visual inspection of scatter plots can help determine whether there is a linear relationship between the independent variable(s) and the dependent variable.\n",
    "2.Residual plots: The residuals can be plotted against the predicted values to determine whether the assumptions of homoscedasticity and linearity hold.\n",
    "3.Normal probability plots: A normal probability plot of the residuals can help determine whether the residuals are normally distributed.\n",
    "4.Variance inflation factor (VIF): The VIF can be calculated for each independent variable to check for multicollinearity.\n",
    "5.Cooks distance: Cooks distance can be used to identify influential outliers that may affect the regression model."

    "Q3. How do you interpret the slope and intercept in a linear regression model? Provide an example using\n",
    "a real-world scenario.\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "In a linear regression model, the slope and intercept of the regression line are important parameters that describe the relationship between the independent variable(s) and the dependent variable.\n",
    "The slope represents the change in the dependent variable for each unit change in the independent variable,\n",

    "\n",
    "In this equation, the intercept is 1000, which represents the sales when the price is zero. \n",
    "Since it is not practical to sell a product for free, the intercept is not particularly meaningful in this scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the slope of -10 is more informative.\n",
    "It tells us that for each one unit increase in price, the sales of the product will decrease by 10 units. \n",
    "In other words, there is a negative linear relationship between the price and sales of the product, with a decrease in sales for each increase in price.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, in this scenario, the slope of the regression line provides important information about the relationship between the price and sales of the product, \n",

    "2.It may be more prone to overfitting, where the model fits the training data too closely and does not generalize well to new data.\n",
