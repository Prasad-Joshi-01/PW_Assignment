    "Here are the main differences between them:\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised Learning:\n",
    "In supervised learning, a labeled dataset is used to train a machine learning model to make predictions on new, unseen data. \n",
    "Labeled data means that each data point is labeled with the correct output, and the model learns from these labeled examples. \n",

    "Unsupervised Learning:\n",
    "In unsupervised learning, an unlabeled dataset is used to train a machine learning model to find patterns or structure in the data. \n",
    "Without any labeled output to guide the learning process, unsupervised learning algorithms must infer the underlying structure or\n",

    "Q6: What is train, test and validation split? Explain the importance Of each term.\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "Train, test, and validation split is a common approach used in machine learning to evaluate and improve the performance of a model. \n",
    "In this approach, the dataset is divided into three separate subsets: a training set, a validation set, and a test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "The training set is used to train the model, i.e., to optimize the model parameters using gradient descent or any other optimization algorithm. \n",
    "The validation set is used to evaluate the performance of the model during training and to perform hyperparameter tuning. \n",
    "The test set is used to assess the final performance of the model on unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The importance of each term is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Training Set: The training set is the most important subset of the data. \n",
    "It is used to train the model to learn the underlying patterns and relationships in the data. \n",
    "The goal is to minimize the error or loss function on the training data by adjusting the model parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Validation Set: The validation set is used to evaluate the performance of the model during training and to perform hyperparameter tuning. \n",
    "During training, the model is evaluated on the validation set after each epoch to check if the model is overfitting or underfitting. \n",
    "Hyperparameters, such as the learning rate, number of hidden layers, or the number of neurons in each layer, are tuned using the validation set to improve the models performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Test Set: The test set is used to assess the final performance of the model on unseen data.\n",
    "It is important to use a separate test set to avoid overfitting and to get an unbiased estimate of the models performance. \n",
    "If the model is overfitted to the training and validation data, it may perform well on those datasets but not on unseen data, \n",
    "which is where the test set comes into play.\n",
    "The test set should not be used for hyperparameter tuning or adjusting the model, but only for the final evaluation of the models performance."

    "Anomalies can be defined as data points that do not conform to the expected pattern of behavior or distribution of the data.\n",

    "One approach to using unsupervised learning for anomaly detection is through clustering algorithms, such as k-means or hierarchical clustering. \n",
    "These algorithms group similar data points together based on their features, and anomalies can be identified as points that do not fit into any of the established clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another approach is through the use of density-based algorithms, such as Local Outlier Factor (LOF) or Isolation Forest. \n",
    "These algorithms identify anomalies by measuring the density of data points and flagging those that fall outside of the expected density range.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, dimensionality reduction techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or\n",
