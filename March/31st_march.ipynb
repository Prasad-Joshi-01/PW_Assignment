    "Q2. Explain the difference between traditional web hosting and cloud hosting.\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "Traditional web hosting and cloud hosting are two different approaches to hosting a website or application on the internet.\n",
    "The main differences between the two are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Infrastructure: Traditional web hosting relies on a single physical server to host websites or applications. \n",
    "Cloud hosting, on the other hand, uses a distributed network of servers to host websites or applications. \n",
    "This makes cloud hosting more scalable and reliable, as resources can be added or removed as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Cost: Traditional web hosting often charges a fixed monthly fee, regardless of usage. \n",
    "Cloud hosting charges based on usage, allowing for more cost-effective scaling and flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Scalability: Traditional web hosting is limited by the resources of a single physical server, making it difficult to scale up or down quickly.\n",
    "Cloud hosting allows for easy scalability, as additional resources can be added or removed as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Availability: Traditional web hosting may experience downtime if the server goes offline or experiences technical issues.\n",
    "Cloud hosting is designed to be highly available, with built-in redundancy and failover capabilities to ensure that websites or \n",
    "applications remain available even in the event of a hardware or software failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Management: Traditional web hosting typically requires more hands-on management and maintenance, such as managing server updates and security patches.\n",
    "Cloud hosting providers often handle much of this management for their customers, allowing them to focus on their core business activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, cloud hosting provides greater scalability, flexibility, and availability compared to traditional web hosting.\n",
    "However, it may be more expensive in certain cases, especially if usage is consistently high. \n",
    "Traditional web hosting may be more cost-effective for small, low-traffic websites or applications, \n",
    "while cloud hosting is more suited for larger, high-traffic websites or applications that require flexibility and scalability."
