    "For example, if the range of test scores for a class is 60 to 90, then the range is 30.\n",

    "Variance: The variance is a measure of how spread out the values in a dataset are from the mean.\n",
    "It is calculated by taking the average of the squared differences between each value and the mean. \n",
    "A higher variance indicates that the values are more spread out, while a lower variance indicates that the values are more tightly clustered around the mean.\n",
    "For example, if the variance of a set of test scores is 100, then the values are more spread out than if the variance is 25.\n",

    "It is the square root of the variance and is expressed in the same units as the original data. \n",
    "The standard deviation is commonly used because it is easy to interpret and is directly related to the normal distribution.\n",
    "A higher standard deviation indicates that the values are more spread out, \n",
