    "Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored in a way that allows for efficient retrieval and manipulation of the data.\n",
    "A database management system (DBMS) is a software application that manages and controls access to the database, and allows users to interact with the data in various ways.\n",
    "SQL databases are relational databases that use a table-based data model to store data.\n",
    "In SQL, data is stored in tables with fixed columns and rows. \n",
    "Each column represents a particular data type, and each row represents a unique record in the table.\n",
    "NoSQL databases, on the other hand, use a non-relational data model to store and retrieve data.\n",
    "NoSQL databases can store data in various formats, such as key-value pairs, document-oriented, graph-based, or column-oriented.\n",
    "NoSQL databases do not require a fixed schema, which means that the data can be added, modified, or deleted without the need to define a schema beforehand."
