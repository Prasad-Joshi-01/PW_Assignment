    "Q1. What is Web Scraping? Why is it Used? Give three areas where Web Scraping is used to get data.\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites using automated tools or software.\n",
    "It involves programmatically collecting data from web pages and then storing it in a structured format like a spreadsheet or a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Web scraping is used for a variety of purposes, including:\n",
    "Data extraction: Web scraping is used to extract data from websites that dont provide an API or other means of accessing their data. \n",
    "This data can be used for research, analysis, or to build applications that rely on up-to-date information.\n",
    "Competitive analysis: Web scraping is often used by businesses to gather information about their competitors. \n",
    "By scraping data from their competitors website, they can gain insights into their products, pricing, marketing strategies, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Three areas where web scraping is commonly used to get data include:\n",
    "1.E-commerce: Web scraping can be used to extract product information from e-commerce sites such as Amazon or eBay. \n",
    "This data can include product details, prices, and customer reviews.\n",
    "2.Finance: Web scraping is used to gather financial data from various sources like stock market websites, news websites, and financial reports.\n",
    "This data can be used for investment analysis, risk assessment, and financial forecasting.\n",
    "3.Social media: Web scraping is used to extract data from social media platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook. \n",

    "Q2. What are the different methods used for Web Scraping?\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "There are several methods used for web scraping, including:\n",
    "1.Manual web scraping: This involves manually copying and pasting data from websites into a spreadsheet or other document. \n",
    "While this method is simple and requires no programming knowledge, it is time-consuming and can only be used for small amounts of data.\n",
    "2.HTML parsing: This involves using a programming language like Python or Ruby to extract data from websites using the HTML structure of the page. \n",
    "This method can be more efficient than manual scraping, but it requires some programming knowledge.\n",
    "3.Web scraping tools: There are many web scraping tools available that can automate the process of extracting data from websites. \n",
    "These tools usually require little to no programming knowledge and can be used to extract large amounts of data quickly.\n",
    "4.APIs: Some websites provide APIs that allow developers to access their data directly. \n",
    "This method is usually more reliable than web scraping because the data is provided in a structured format."
